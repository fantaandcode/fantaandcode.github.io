## Prediction Biases of the Members of CapitalistDota's Discord
### Group Stage

How bias is determined is:

- Team bias
  - For every game prediction, a 2-0 for a team has that team bias increased by 1
  - For every game prediction, a 1-1 or tied prediction will increase both team's bias by 0.5
- Region bias
  - Take the sum of all the region's team biases
  - Divide by the number of series predicted
  - Multiply by the number of teams overall (18)
  - Divide by the number of teams in the region

To look at your individual biases, double click your Discord name on the legend. It will isolate your name and your name alone.

        <p>You're a courier delivering a package across a county, city, country. I haven't decided the scope yet. I'm using this mainly to learn 3D in Godot for now. This idea has been floating around in my head for a fair bit, but I just never got the time to work on the actual game that much. Mostly due to procrastination. Icon is temporary.</p>
